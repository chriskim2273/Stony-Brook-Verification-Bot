Stony-Brook-Verification-Bot

A discord bot that I created that can be used to verify if a person attends Stony Brook University using their email.
I used MongoDB to store the data, Google SMTP to send the pin code, and Discord JDA API for the bot itself.

This can me modified to be utilized for other school emails and I am considering making it flexible for any university or email.


PLANS: 
  * Encrpyt the emails
